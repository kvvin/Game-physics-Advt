This repository contains a playble apk file, a video of the movie scene, implementation video and the code used.
The apk file contains a ball and some cones. The ball moves according to the accelerometer in your phone. The app works in landscape mode.
Move your phone to start rolling the ball.
The movie scene shows a car accelerating and then decelerating to stop once it crashes. I have implemented the deceleration physics into the ball game, where once the ball collides with cones and the walls it comes to a stop after rolling(accelerating).
The movement.cs file has the code which uses the accelerometer of the phone to controll the ball, and box colliders on the cones and the walls and the circle colliders on the ball helped the ball to stop once it collides.
